# Endpoint Plotter and GUI
_________________
This repository is real-time plotter and GUI for the Oxford-RIE tool in the University of Virginia Microfabrication Labs. It can connect to any serial connection from an ADC / uController device and plot the received data in real-time. The GUI program is built on PyQt5. The views were generated using QtDesigner and turned to python code using the built-in pyuic executable.

See the docs for details!
